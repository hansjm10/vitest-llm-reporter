# Research Findings: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Overview
Research conducted to resolve technical decisions and best practices for implementing a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for the vitest-llm-reporter NPM package.

## Key Decisions

### 1. GitHub Actions Version Strategy
**Decision**: Use latest stable action versions with pinned major versions
**Rationale**:
- Provides security updates and bug fixes automatically
- Major version pinning prevents breaking changes
- Aligns with GitHub's recommended best practices
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full SHA pinning: Too rigid, misses security updates
- Latest tags: Too unstable, risk of unexpected breakage

### 2. Node.js Version Management
**Decision**: Use Node.js 17+ as specified in README, with matrix testing for 18, 20, 22
**Rationale**:
- Project requires Node 17+ for native `structuredClone`
- Testing multiple versions ensures compatibility
- Node 18, 20 are LTS versions; 22 is current
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single version: Insufficient compatibility testing
- All versions 17+: Excessive CI time for minimal benefit

### 3. NPM Publishing Strategy
**Decision**: Manual trigger via GitHub Release creation
**Rationale**:
- Maintains human control over releases
- GitHub Releases provide changelog and tagging
- Prevents accidental publications
- Supports pre-release versions naturally
**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-publish on merge: Too risky for public packages
- Scheduled releases: Doesn't align with feature-based releases

### 4. Version Control Strategy
**Decision**: Semantic versioning with automated version bumping based on commit messages
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for NPM packages
- Conventional commits enable automation
- Clear communication of breaking changes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual versioning: Error-prone, inconsistent
- Date-based versioning: Not suitable for libraries

### 5. Test Coverage Requirements
**Decision**: 80% coverage threshold with reporting to PR comments
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard baseline
- Prevents coverage regression
- Visible feedback in PR review process
**Alternatives considered**:
- No threshold: Allows quality degradation
- 100% coverage: Unrealistic, encourages gaming metrics

### 6. PR Check Requirements
**Decision**: Required checks for tests, coverage, lint, type-check, and build
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive quality gates
- Catches issues before merge
- Maintains code consistency
**Alternatives considered**:
- Tests only: Insufficient quality control
- All checks optional: Allows bypassing quality gates

### 7. Authentication Method
**Decision**: NPM automation token stored in GitHub Secrets
**Rationale**:
- Secure credential management
- Supports 2FA-enabled accounts
- GitHub's recommended approach
**Alternatives considered**:
- User tokens: Less secure, tied to individual
- No authentication: Can't publish to NPM

### 8. Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Cache node_modules and npm cache between runs
**Rationale**:
- Significantly reduces CI time
- GitHub Actions provides built-in caching
- Standard practice for Node.js projects
**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching: Slower CI runs
- Docker layer caching: Overcomplicated for this use case

### 9. Matrix Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Test on Ubuntu (primary), Windows, and macOS for releases only
**Rationale**:
- Ubuntu for fast PR feedback
- Cross-platform validation before releases
- Balances thoroughness with CI minutes
**Alternatives considered**:
- Ubuntu only: Misses platform-specific issues
- All platforms always: Excessive CI usage

### 10. Artifact Management
**Decision**: Store test results and coverage reports for 7 days
**Rationale**:
- Enables debugging of failures
- Coverage history tracking
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
**Alternatives considered**:
- No artifacts: Harder to debug failures
- Permanent storage: Unnecessary cost

## Best Practices Identified

### GitHub Actions Best Practices
1. Use composite actions for reusable workflows
2. Set job timeouts to prevent hanging
3. Use concurrency groups to cancel outdated runs
4. Implement retry logic for flaky operations
5. Use GitHub's built-in annotations for error reporting

### NPM Publishing Best Practices
1. Always run `npm ci` instead of `npm install` in CI
2. Use `--ignore-scripts` flag for security
3. Include provenance data in published packages
4. Verify package contents before publishing
5. Use npm's 2FA for enhanced security

### Security Considerations
1. Use OIDC for NPM authentication when available
2. Minimize secret exposure with minimal permission tokens
3. Enable Dependabot for action updates
4. Use CodeQL for security scanning
5. Implement CODEOWNERS for workflow changes

## Implementation Requirements

### Required GitHub Secrets
- `NPM_TOKEN`: Automation token for publishing
- Optional: `CODECOV_TOKEN` if using Codecov

### Required Repository Settings
- Branch protection rules for main branch
- Required status checks before merge
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- Require up-to-date branches

### Workflow Files Structure
```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml          # PR validation workflow
│   ├── release.yml     # NPM publishing workflow
│   └── codeql.yml      # Security scanning (optional)
├── actions/
│   └── setup/          # Reusable setup action
└── dependabot.yml      # Automated dependency updates
```

## Resolved Clarifications

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved:
- Minimum coverage threshold: 80%
- Required PR checks: tests, coverage, lint, type-check, build
- Version strategy: Semantic versioning with conventional commits
- NPM authentication: Automation tokens via GitHub Secrets
- Pipeline triggers: PR events, release creation
- Test framework: Vitest (existing)
- Additional checks: Linting, type checking, security scanning
- Notifications: GitHub native notifications
- Release authorization: Manual via GitHub Release creation
- Pre-release support: Via GitHub Release pre-release flag

## Summary

This research provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing a modern, secure, and efficient CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. All technical decisions are based on current best practices and optimized for the specific needs of an NPM library project.
