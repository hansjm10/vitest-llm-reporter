# Feature Specification: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want a CI/CD pipeline integrated with Github actions. I want to be able to push to NPM directly and handle version control. I want to be able to run tests. I want to be able to run coverage. I want to add checks to PR's."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project maintainer, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline that runs quality checks on every pull request and enables me to publish new versions to NPM when code is merged to the main branch, so that I can ensure code quality and streamline the release process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer creates a pull request, **When** the PR is opened or updated, **Then** automated tests and coverage reports should run and display results as PR checks
2. **Given** all PR checks have passed and the PR is approved, **When** the code is merged to the main branch, **Then** the pipeline should prepare the package for potential release to NPM
3. **Given** a maintainer wants to release a new version, **When** they trigger the release process with appropriate permissions, **Then** the package should be automatically published to NPM with the correct version
4. **Given** tests are running in the pipeline, **When** any test fails, **Then** the PR check should fail and block merging until fixed
5. **Given** code coverage is calculated, **When** coverage drops below [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum coverage threshold not specified], **Then** appropriate warnings or blocks should be triggered

### Edge Cases
- What happens when NPM publish fails due to network issues or authentication problems?
- How does the system handle concurrent PRs that might conflict?
- What occurs when version numbers conflict with existing published versions?
- How are rollbacks handled if a bad version is published?
- What happens when GitHub Actions quota or NPM rate limits are exceeded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST run automated tests on every pull request before allowing merge
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate and report code coverage for each PR
- **FR-003**: System MUST display test and coverage results as checks on GitHub pull requests
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent merging when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which checks should be required/blocking?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST support publishing packages to NPM registry
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle version control [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: semantic versioning strategy? manual vs automatic version bumping?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate with NPM using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - tokens, 2FA handling?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST run on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which events trigger the pipeline - push, PR, manual, scheduled?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which test frameworks and coverage tools?]
- **FR-010**: PR checks MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: besides tests and coverage, what other checks - linting, security scanning, build validation?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST notify stakeholders when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: notification requirements - failures, successes, publish events?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: build artifacts, test reports, coverage history retention period?]
- **FR-013**: NPM publishing MUST be restricted to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: who can trigger releases - maintainers only, automated on merge, manual approval required?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pre-release versions, beta/alpha channels, dist-tags?]
