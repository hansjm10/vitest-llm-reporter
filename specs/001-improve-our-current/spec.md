# Feature Specification: Improve Test Reporter by Removing Duplicate Logs

**Feature Branch**: `001-improve-our-current`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Improve our current test reporter by improving and removing duplicate logs that may be triggered from multiple tests."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: test reporter, duplicate logs, multiple tests
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer running test suites, I want to see clean and deduplicated test output so that I can quickly identify test failures and errors without being overwhelmed by redundant log messages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a test suite with multiple tests that trigger the same log message at the same log level, **When** the tests run, **Then** the log message appears only once in the test output with a count indicator
2. **Given** a test reporter encountering duplicate log messages from different test files at the same log level, **When** generating the report, **Then** duplicate messages are consolidated and the duplicates are tracked but not displayed
3. **Given** multiple tests logging similar messages at different log levels (e.g., Debug vs Warning), **When** viewing the test results, **Then** both messages are displayed since they have different severity levels
4. **Given** the deduplication feature is disabled via configuration, **When** tests run, **Then** all log messages are displayed including duplicates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when duplicate logs have slightly different timestamps?
- How does system handle similar (but not identical) log messages at the same level?
- What happens when duplicate logs occur across parallel test execution?
- How does the system handle duplicate logs from setup/teardown hooks versus test bodies?
- What happens when processing 1000+ tests with extensive logging?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect duplicate log messages that originate from multiple test executions
- **FR-002**: System MUST consolidate duplicate log messages into a single entry with appropriate metadata showing occurrence count
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve the ability to trace which tests generated specific log messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST indicate when a log message has been deduplicated and show the count of occurrences
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain chronological ordering of unique log entries
- **FR-006**: System MUST consider logs as duplicates when they have the same log level (Debug, Info, Warning, Error) and contain the same or similar message content
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply deduplication to all console logging methods (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, etc.)
- **FR-008**: Deduplication MUST work across the entire test run, consolidating duplicates from all tests and test files
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a configuration option to enable or disable log deduplication
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle performance efficiently for test suites containing 1000+ tests
- **FR-011**: System MUST NOT deduplicate logs that have the same content but different log levels (e.g., a Debug and a Warning with same message are shown separately)
- **FR-012**: System MUST track but not display subsequent duplicate logs at the same level

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Log Message**: Represents a single log entry with content, timestamp, source test, and log level (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)
- **Test Context**: Identifies which test or test suite generated a specific log message
- **Deduplication Metadata**: Tracks occurrence count and original sources for consolidated messages at the same log level
