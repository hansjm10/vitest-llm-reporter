# Vitest LLM Reporter

A zero-config Vitest reporter that outputs concise, structured JSON optimized for LLM consumption.

## Features

- üöÄ 50% smaller output than default reporter
- ü§ñ Structured JSON perfect for LLM parsing
- üìç Automatic code context extraction for failures
- ‚ö° Zero configuration required
- üîß TypeScript types included

## Requirements

- Node.js 17.0.0 or higher (uses native `structuredClone` API)
- Vitest 3.0.0 or higher

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest-llm-reporter
```

## Usage

Add the reporter to your `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    reporters: ['vitest-llm-reporter']
  }
})
```

Or specify an output file:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    reporters: [
      ['vitest-llm-reporter', { 
        outputFile: './test-results.json' 
      }]
    ]
  }
})
```

That's it! The reporter will automatically extract failure context and output structured JSON.

### Optional: Per-test streaming output

If you prefer live, per-test console updates, use the `StreamingReporter`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { StreamingReporter } from 'vitest-llm-reporter'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    // Enable live output
    reporters: [new StreamingReporter({ enableStreaming: true })]
  }
})
```

Note: `StreamingReporter` is a thin wrapper around the base reporter that prints simple, real-time lines as tests complete. It does not change the JSON output behavior.

## Output Format

The reporter generates concise JSON with only the essential information for understanding test results:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total": 10,
    "passed": 8,
    "failed": 2,
    "skipped": 0,
    "duration": 1234,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "failures": [
    {
      "test": "should calculate tax correctly",
      "file": "/src/tax.test.ts",
      "line": 45,
      "error": {
        "message": "Expected 105.50 but got 105.00",
        "type": "AssertionError",
        "context": {
          "code": [
            "44: const price = 100;",
            "45: expect(calculateTax(price)).toBe(105.50);",
            "46: // Tax should be 5.5%"
          ],
          "expected": 105.50,
          "actual": 105.00,
          "lineNumber": 45
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The output focuses on failures with their context, keeping passed tests minimal to save tokens.

## Debugging

If the reporter isn't working as expected, enable debug output:

```bash
DEBUG=vitest:llm-reporter:* npm test
```

## Migration from Previous Versions

### Removed Configuration Options

The following configuration options have been removed in the latest version:

- **`streamingMode`**: This legacy flag has been removed. Use `enableStreaming` instead.
- **`streaming`** config object and **`StreamingConfig`** type: This unimplemented configuration block has been removed. Streaming behavior is now controlled solely by the `enableStreaming` boolean flag.
- **`TruncationConfig.enableStreamingTruncation`**: This unused option has been removed from truncation configuration.

**Migration Guide:**
- If you were using `streamingMode`, replace it with `enableStreaming`
- If you had any `streaming: { ... }` configuration, it can be safely removed as it was not being used
- Streaming behavior continues to work via the single `enableStreaming` boolean, which defaults to auto-detection based on TTY
